# 2019-6-_Exploring-Weather-Trends

## Description:
This project is part of both Data Analyst and Professional Data Analysis Nanodegrees with Udacity. 
In this project, I will analyze local city (Cairo) and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

## Tools or Programming languages used:
- Excel - SQL

## Outlines:

- Moving average Calculation:
  - Decided to make the moving average one for both Global and city
Temperature with a decade basis.

- Key considerations when decided how to visualize the trends:
  - I removed all Global Temp before 1808 as there are no data for my
nearest largest city (Cairo) and after 2013 for the same reason.

- Extract the data
  - Tool used for extracting data : SQL
  - SQL query to extract the city level data and then Export to CSV.
