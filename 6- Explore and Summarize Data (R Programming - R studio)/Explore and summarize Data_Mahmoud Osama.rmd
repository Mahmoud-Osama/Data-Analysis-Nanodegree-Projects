> In this section, We will perform some preliminary exploration of
our dataset. Run some summaries of the data and create univariate plots to
understand the structure of the individual variables in our dataset.

# Univariate Analysis

>*Now that we've completed our univariate explorations, it's time to
reflect on and summarize what you've found*

### What is the structure of your dataset?

```{r }
str(rw)
```
>**Our dataset consists of 13 variables with 1501 observations after:**  

>   - **Removing the top 1% of (Fixed acidity,residual sugar, chlorides, free and total sulfur dioxide, and sulphates)**
>   - **Removing the X column of index.**
>   - **adding anew column rating which is an ordered factor based on quality.**

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

>**Sure, Quality is the main Feature of interest as the main objective of that project to determine what affects the quality of wine (bad or good or Excellent)**

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

>**I think sulphates, density and alcohol content are the most important features that may affect quality and also the created rating column will support our investagation.**

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

>**yes, We have created a new column called rating which is an ordered factor based on quality with three levels (Bad,Good,Excellent) as it will help our analysis**

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? \Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form \of the data? If so, why did you do this?

> - **yes,**
>   - **As we noticed that data transformation (log tranformation) can be applied on several variables (residual sugar, chlorides, free and total sulfur dioxide, and sulphates) as their histograms are positively skewed.**
>   - **We also needed to remove the top 1% for (fixed acidity, the residual sugar,chlorides, free.sulfur.dioxide, total.sulfur.dioxide, and sulphates) variables that had the most extreme outliers.**
>   - **We removed the x column as it was only an index**

# Bivariate Plots Section

> **In this section, We will find out what relationships between variables might be interesting to look at ? we wonâ€™t stop to relationships between a main output feature and one of the supporting variables but we will try to look at relationships between supporting variables as well.**

# Final Plots and Summary

> **Tip**: You've done a lot of exploration and have built up an understanding
of the structure of and relationships between the variables in your dataset.
Here, you will select three plots from all of your previous exploration to
present here as a summary of some of your most interesting findings. Make sure
that you have refined your selected plots for good titling, axis labels (with
units), and good aesthetic choices (e.g. color, transparency). After each plot,
make sure you justify why you chose each plot by describing what it shows.

### Plot One : Histogram_all_Variables

``````{r echo=FALSE, Plot_One}

    facet_wrap(~variable,scales = "free")+geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "darkred")+labs(title = "Histograms for all variables in our dataset")
```


### Description One : Histogram_all_Variables

> **that plot displays a histogram for all variables of our dataset for (red wine), in which we notice that:**


> **- data transformation (log tranformation) can be applied on several variables (residual sugar, chlorides, free and total sulfur dioxide, and sulphates) as their histograms are positively skewed.**
> **- we will also need to remove the top 1% for (fixed acidity, the residual sugar,chlorides, free.sulfur.dioxide, total.sulfur.dioxide, and sulphates) variables that had the most extreme outliers which make it difficult to see the distribution then re-plot their histograms.**

> **so, through that plot we got a general indication of the distribution of the different variables and what we really need to tidy our data and start our analysis.**

### Description Two: Quality vs. other variables Box Plots


> - **from the first glance, we will notice the high positive correlation between (alcohol,the crtic.acid and sulphat) and quality**

> - **We will notice also the high negative correlation between (volatile.acid,density and PH) and quality**

> - **which gives an important indication about the most important variables affects red wine quality.**


### Plot Three: alcohol vs. volatile.acidity vs. quality

```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Three}

ggplot(data = rw, aes(alcohol, volatile.acidity, color = as.factor(quality))) +
geom_point() +xlab('alcohol (percentage by volume)') +ylab('volatile.acidity (g / dm^3)')+facet_wrap(~rating) +theme_gray() +scale_color_brewer(type = 'seq', palette = 5)

```


### Description Three : alcohol vs. volatile.acidity vs. quality

> **that plot proves the strong and different effect both alcohol and volatile.acidity properties have over the quality of red wine 
as we notice that alcohol has a high positive relation with red wine quality while volatile.acidity has a high negative relation with red wine quality**

# Reflection

**- In this project we have explored red wine chemical properties for 1,599 red wines data set, we have started by Displaying a structure and summary of our dataset then making a plot and quick analysis for our main output (quality) in which we knew that  quality rating is ranged between 3 (the lowest)and 8(the highest)and most of the quality ratings are either 5 or 6 and creating rating  factor with three levels that became really valuable in multivariate plots section.** 

**- We started to get more deep into univeriate plots and analysis which included cleaning and data transformation for some variables then making   histograms and boxplots for all variables.**

**- We got into Bivariate Plots section and started by getting the correlation and relationship between quality and other variables through box plots and we found out that there is a high positive correlation between (alcohol,the crtic.acid and sulphat) and quality and a high negative correlation between (volatile.acid,density and PH) and quality and got relationship between other variables with each other.**

**- In Multivariate plot section, we made sure to get a descriptive Multivariate plot that justify all previous results with simplicity and we succeeded and justified many points such as the negative relation between alcohol and Density and between alcohol and volatile.acidity,
while there is a positive relation between alcohol and citric.acid.**

## Difficulties and Successes


**-Cleaning the data from outliers.**

**-Adjusting the distribution of right skewed variables through log transformation.**

**-Making a descriptive Multivariate plot that justify all previous results with simplicity.**

**-Align the markdown parts and add relevant comments in a good manner.**



## Future Work

**-We should develop a statistical model to predict red wine quality.**
